Two ways

Pricing And Performance

1)On Demand(Hourly)
2)Reserved instance(For a particular time)
3)Dedicaded (Hardware allocatied)
4)Spot instance(Bidding)

Performance
1)General purpose(T2.micro)
2)Compute optimised based
3)Memory optimised based
4)Storage optimised based
5)Accelerated compute instance

VPC(Virtual private cloud)

IPv4 CIDR block(Calssless inter-Domain routing)

NATGateWay(Network address translation) - - It Allows Out side

Role & Policy

Role - resources

Policy - for user

VPC Peering

2 Types
Inter VPC Peering(B/W different regions)
Intra VPC Peering(B/W same region)

Connectivity B/W VPC's is call VPC Peering


S3 (Global service)

CRR - Cross region replication -- two buckets in differnet regions
life cycle rule management -- Moment of data from one storage to another type of storage

through cmd line or console upload max 0 ti 5 tb through cmd
bucket -- Folder
object  -- Files


Differnt storage

Standard
Infrequent accessed storage
One zone infrequent
Intelligent tiering access storage
Glacier storage
Deep archieved glacier storage

Auto scalling

CPU and based on policies and scheduler

auto scalling has two ways
Schedulers (Cron Jobs, Max and min)
Policies(Increase and decrease group size based on CPU or memory)

Launch Configuration :

RDS(RDBMS)

Read replica
Multi avilablity zone

Subnets:

10.10.0.0/172.168.0.0/192.168.0.0/


VPC end point :

Private Subnet - Not connect to Internet gateway
Public Subnet -
